Basic Trading Strategy
======================

.. Note::
    The following strategy closely follows the implementations:

    `Pairs trading: a copula approach. (2013) <https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jdhf.2013.1>`__ by Liew, Rong Qi, and Yuan Wu.

    `Trading strategies with copulas. (2013) <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/318054326>`__ by Stander, Yolanda, DaniÃ«l Marais, and Ilse Botha.

The trading strategy using copula is implemented as a long-short pairs trading scheme, and uses rules from the general
long-short pairs trading framework.

Conditional Probabilities
#########################

We start with a pair of stocks of interest :math:`S_1` and :math:`S_2`, which can be selected by various methods.
For example, using the Engle-Granger test for cointegration.
By consensus, we define the spread as :math:`S_1` in relation to :math:`S_2`.
e.g. Short the spread means buying :math:`S_1` and/or selling :math:`S_2`.

Use **prices** data of the stocks during the training/formation period, we proceed with a pseudo-MLE
fit to establish a copula that reflects the relation of the two stocks during the training/formation period.

Then we can calculate the **conditional probabilities** using trading/testing period data:

.. math::
    \begin{align}
    P(U_1\le u_1 | U_2 = u_2), \\
    P(U_2\le u_2 | U_1 = u_1).
    \end{align}

- :math:`u_i \in [0, 1]` is the quantile of trading period data mapped by a CDF formed in the training period.

- When :math:`P(U_1\le u_1 | U_2 = u_2) < 0.5`, then stock 1 is considered under-valued.

- When :math:`P(U_1\le u_1 | U_2 = u_2) > 0.5`, then stock 1 is considered over-valued.

Trading Logic
#############

Now we define an upper threshold :math:`b_{up}` (e.g. 0.95) and a lower threshold :math:`b_{lo}` (e.g. 0.05),
then the logic is as follows:

- If :math:`P(U_1\le u_1 | U_2 = u_2) \le b_{lo}` and :math:`P(U_2\le u_2 | U_1 = u_1) \ge b_{up}`, then stock 1 is
  undervalued, and stock 2 is overvalued. Hence we long the spread. ( :math:`1` in position)

- If :math:`P(U_2\le u_2 | U_1 = u_1) \le b_{lo}` and :math:`P(U_1\le u_1 | U_2 = u_2) \ge b_{up}`, then stock 2 is
  undervalued, and stock 1 is overvalued. Hence we short the spread. ( :math:`-1` in position)

- If both/either conditional probabilities cross the boundary of :math:`0.5`, then we exit the position, as we consider
  the position no longer valid. ( :math:`0` in position)

Ambiguities and Comments
************************

The authors did not specify what will happen if the followings occur:

1. When there is an open signal and an exit signal.
    
2. When there is an open signal and currently there is a position.
    
3. When there is a long and short signal together.

Here is our take:

1. Exit signal overrides open signal.

2. Flip the position to the signal's suggestion. For example, originally have a short position, and receives a long
   signal, then the position becomes long.
   
3. Technically this should never happen with the default trading logic. However, if it did happen for whatever
   reason, long + short signal will lead to no opening signal and the positions will not change, unless there is
   an exit signal and that resets the position to 0.

For exiting a position, the authors proposed using **'and'** logic: Both conditional probabilities need to cross :math:`0.5`.
However, we found this too strict and sometimes fails to exit a position when it should. Therefore we also provide the
**'or'** logic: At least one of the conditional probabilities cross :math:`0.5`.

Implementation
##############

.. Warning::
    The original :code:`CopulaStrategy` class is still available in Arbitrage Lab but is considered a legacy module.
    One can keep using it if it is already in use, but we highly recommend new users to use :code:`BasicCopulaStrategy`
    exclusively for more flexibility, better consistency with other copula modules, and full support of :code:`pandas`.

.. automodule:: arbitragelab.copula_approach.copula_strategy_basic
        
    .. autoclass:: BasicCopulaStrategy
	:members: __init__, fit_copula, get_positions, to_quantile, get_info_criterion, get_condi_probs, get_cur_position

Example
*******

.. code-block::

   # Importing the module and other libraries
   from arbitragelab.copula_approach.copula_strategy_basic import BasicCopulaStrategy
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import pandas as pd

   # Instantiating the module
   BCS = BasicCopulaStrategy()

   # Loading the data
   pair_prices = pd.read_csv('PRICE_DATA.csv', index_col='Dates', parse_dates=True)

   # Split data into train and test sets
   prices_train = pair_prices.iloc[:int(len(s1_price)*0.7)]
   prices_test = pair_prices.iloc[int(len(s1_price)*0.7):]

   # Fitting to a Student-t copula
   result_dict, copula, s1_cdf, s2_cdf = BCS.fit_copula(data=prices_train,
                                                        copula_name='Student')
													   
   # Printing fit scores (AIC, SIC, HQIC, log-likelihood)
   print(result_dict)

   # Forming position series using trading period data, assuming holding no position initially.
   # Also changing lower and upper bound to 0.1 and 0.9 respectively.
   # 'AND' exit logic:
   positions_and = BCS.get_positions(data=prices_test, cdf1=s1_cdf, cdf2=s2_cdf,
                                     init_pos=0, open_thresholds=(0.1, 0.9))

   # 'OR' exit logic:
   positions_or = BCS.get_positions(data=prices_test, cdf1=s1_cdf, cdf2=s2_cdf,
                                    init_pos=0, open_thresholds=(0.1, 0.9), exit_rule='or')
   
   # Graph from the fitted copula
   ax = plt.subplot()
   copula.plot(num=1000, ax=ax)
   plt.show()
   
   # Sample 2000 times from the fitted copula
   samples = copula.generate_pairs(num=2000)
